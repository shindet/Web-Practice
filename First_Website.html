    <br>
    Inside my telescope I see <br>
    A pair of eyes looking back at me <br>
    He walks, and talks, and looks like me <br>
    Sits around inside his house <br>
    From room to room he moves around <br>
    Fills his life with pointless things <br>
    And wonders how its all turned out
